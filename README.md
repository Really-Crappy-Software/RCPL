# RCPL
# Really Crappy Port Listener
* NOTE: I added a logging system so if you wnat the logs you are going to have to turn off rcpl using the shutdown code by sending that code to rcpl from another socket. for this you could use rctds 
* SYNTAX rcpl PORT
* Fun Fact: this is my first dive into socket programming, so I hope you like it.
